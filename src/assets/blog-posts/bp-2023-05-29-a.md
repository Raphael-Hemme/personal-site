This is a list of resources I find helpful to get for learning Clojure / ClojureScript. The list is in development as I'm going on learning which I might put on hold for a moment since currently I would prefer to learn a compiled FP language which makes me lean toward Haskell.

But I think the list of resources might still helpful for my future self or anyone who stumbles over it since I found the resources on the official ClojureScript site to be either outdated or to place a big hurdle right at the start with the need to install and get everything to work correctly.

This is a list of resources I find helpful for learning Clojure / ClojureScript. It is mainly a collection of links, that I find useful at the moment since I found the resources on the official ClojureScript site to be either outdated or to require quite a bit of tinkering in order to get everything to work correctly. I'll update the list as I'm going on learning Clojure.

### General Clojure / ClojureScript Resources

#### Books

- [Clojure for the Brave and True](https://www.braveclojure.com/clojure-for-the-brave-and-true/)
  - A book about Clojure by [Daniel Higginbotham](https://github.com/flyingmachine)

- [Learn ClojureScript](https://www.learn-clojurescript.com/)
  - A book about ClojureScript by [Andrew Meredith](https://github.com/kendru)

#### Videos

 - [A Intro to Clojure and Clojure syntax](https://youtu.be/uwRFOFvd-CU)

#### Articles, Posts & Tutorials

- [Learning ClojureScript with P5.js](/https://somecho.github.io/en/blog/learning-clojurescript-with-p5js/)
	- A tutorial about working with P5.JS in ClojureScript by [somecho](https://somecho.github.io/en/)

#### Websites and online REPLs

- [ClojureScript.io](https://clojurescript.io)
	- An online REPL with helpful info on the different operators, funcitons, data types, macros and so on for which examples can be loaded into the REPL

- [ClojureScript.net](http://clojurescript.net/)
	- Another online REPL for ClojureScript. It looks quite similar to the ClojureScript.io above but less convenient. (I'd prefer the above one.)

- [Clojure Koans](http://clojurekoans.com) 
	- The website with Git and run instructions for Clojure Koans

- [Clojure Script Koans](http://clojurescriptkoans.com) 
	- An online version of clojure koans for ClojureScript

#### IDEs, REPLs and Tooling stuff

- [Calva](https://calva.io)
	- A VSCode extension that transforms VSCode into an IDE with a REPL for Clojure and ClojureScript. It also comes with some intro lessons to Calva itself and Clojure

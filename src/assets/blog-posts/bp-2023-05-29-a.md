This is a list of resources I find helpful to get for learning Clojure / ClojureScript. The list is in development as I'm going on learning.

But I think the list of resources might still helpful for my future self or anyone who stumbles over it since I found the resources on the official ClojureScript site to be either outdated or to place a big hurdle right at the start with the need to install and get everything to work correctly.

### Videos

 - [A Intro to Clojure and Clojure syntax](https://youtu.be/uwRFOFvd-CU)

### Websites and online REPLs

- [ClojureScript.io](https://clojurescript.io)
	- An online REPL with helpful info on the different operators, funcitons, data types, macros and so on for which examples can be loaded into the REPL

- [ClojureScript.net](http://clojurescript.net/)
	- Another online REPL for ClojureScript. It looks quite similar to the ClojureScript.io above but less convenient. (I'd prefer the above one.)

- [Clojure Koans](http://clojurekoans.com) 
	- The website with Git and run instructions for Clojure Koans

- [Clojure Script Koans](http://clojurescriptkoans.com) 
	- An online version of clojure koans for ClojureScript

### IDEs, REPLs and Tooling stuff

- [Calva](https://calva.io)
	- A VSCode extension that transforms VSCode into an IDE with a REPL for Clojure and ClojureScript. It also comes with some intro lessons to Calva itself and Clojure
